# Ray Tracer
my first try at a ray tracer, written in C++ for my Computer Graphics course.

It's a simple implementation that only supports planes and spheres. It includes:
- phong shading/lighting
- shadows
- reflection
- refraction
- anti-aliasing
- multiple scenes

there are some minor bugs and optimization issues but I probably won't be fixing them / working on this much as I build a larger-scale implementation from scratch in my free time

(this is without anti-aliasing turned on)
